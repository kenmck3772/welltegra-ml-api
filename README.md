# WellTegra ML API | Brahan Intelligence Refinery

The backend inference engine for the Brahan Engine, facilitating the transition from historical data to predictive foresight.

## 🧠 ML Status & Model Cards
* **Vertex AI Integration:** The pipeline is architected for Gemini 2.0 (Vertex AI) inference. Inference hooks are active; real-time performance is currently optimized for forensic report generation.
* **Data Origin:** Models are fine-tuned/grounded on historical forensic signatures from BSEE (Incident 2011-2021) and Volve datasets.
* **Predictive Latency:** Target for end-to-end inference + UI delivery is <3 seconds.
